I am going to develop a desktop app for my brothers sushi restaurant to keep track of the sales made.

That is going to be the first version and later I want to also add an inventory manager, to keep track of the inventory, for this I will need to do some research about how other developers manage inventories and 
also I have already an idea but I am not sure if is going to be so precise managing the inventories.

I am deciding if using Java or Python for the GUI. I think it could be easier for me if I use Java because I've created GUI's with Java before.
I will like to use python to learn the syntaxis about OOP because I already know most of it in Java and C++ but not in Python.
