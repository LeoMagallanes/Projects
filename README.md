# Projects
In this repository you will find some of the school project that I've done.

Sorting Algorithms:
This is a project where a implement 8 different sorting algorithms and I compared their running time with random data generated.

I implemented:
Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort, quick Sort, Merge Sort and Radix Sort.

The biggest challenge of this project was knowing how do these algorithms works and implementing them. Another problem that I found out was keeping tack of the time that 
each algorithm took to complete.

This was a school project.

Dijsktra.
In this project I used adjacency matrixes to implement the Dijkstra algorihm. The program can asnwer queries about wat is the fastest time to get to another city, smallest distance from one city to another comparing different roads and also which way is the cheapest.

We have 10 cities and 31 roads.

The main challenge in this project was, implementing the dijsktra algorithm and also using graphs because I was unfamiliarized with using graphs, so it was challenging for me to make this project work.
